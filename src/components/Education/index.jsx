      In 2019, I graduated from Easter Mediterranean University with a degree in
      International Finance, achieving the top position in my class with a
      perfect CGPA of 4.00 out of 4.00.

      In 2020, I embarked on an immersive learning journey by joining Recoded,
      where I stood out as a top 4% candidate for their front-end development
      program. This program, in partnership with Flatiron School, provided me
      with a robust skill set encompassing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
      Firebase, Redux, Agile methodologies, Git, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since then, my educational journey has been a continual process, involving
      engagement in various projects, video tutorials, workshops, and diverse
      courses, ensuring that I stay updated and continually enhance my skill
      set.
