    <p>
      As a seasoned Frontend Developer, I&apos;ve honed my skills and expertise
      through immersive experiences within diverse organizations, spearheading
      innovative projects and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. My
      journey in the realm of software development began in February 2021 when I
      joined Smartup Network, a dynamic company deeply engaged in supporting
      startups&apos; growth and success.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my tenure at Smartup Network, I embraced the fast-paced,
      entrepreneurial environment, immersing myself in a myriad of
      responsibilities. Working alongside designers, backend developers, and
      product owners, I swiftly transitioned to taking charge of projects
      independently within the first three months. This period proved
      instrumental in expanding my technical repertoire, mastering frameworks
      like Vue, Nuxtjs, Nextjs, Redux, React Native, and AGILE methodologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my tenure, I spearheaded and maintained several successful
      projects, including Inodash, pricematch, hobeematch, widio, bizim
      tarifler, staalx, among others. As my journey progressed, my role evolved
      from a full-time employee to a dedicated freelancer for Smartup Network.
      This transition provided me with the opportunity to lead a team,
      contribute to technical interviews, conduct training sessions, perform
      comprehensive code reviews, mentor new hires, and interface with clients
      when necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequently, my career trajectory led me to Akinon, where I contributed
      my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Agile methodologies.
      Collaborating with cross-functional teams encompassing designers, product
      owners, frontend and backend developers, I had the privilege of working on
      UI development and maintenance for renowned global brands like Converse,
      Polo, Nautica, Gant, Atasay, and numerous others.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Akinon, I contributed to crafting state-of-the-art omnichannel
      solutions, leveraging my expertise in software development to support the
      world&apos;s top retail brands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, at TÄ±kla Gelsin since February 2023, I continue to apply my
      proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NX, Zustand, MUI, Agile
      methodologies, and microfrontend architecture. My focus revolves around a
      pivotal project aimed at establishing a robust B2B organizational
      management system, collaborating seamlessly with frontend and backend
      developers, designers, and product owners to drive this vision forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      My professional journey reflects a commitment to innovation, collaborative
      prowess, and an unyielding dedication to delivering exceptional results in
      the realm of frontend development.
